**A**

When Paul Jackson was a boy, he lived near an old copper smelter (冶炼厂) which polluted the environment seriously. A beautiful forest nearby was made into a wasteland. He vowed (发誓) that someday he would make the land green again.

While at college, he chose botany (植物学). He met a professor who was an expert in ecology (生态学). He told Paul it would take about twenty thousand years to make that wasteland green again.

Then Paul got married and had some kids. But his dream would not die. He kept thinking about it. One night he took some action. He [sneaked out]{.underline} into the wasteland with a backpack full of seedlings and started planting. For seven hours, he planted the seedlings. Every week, he made his secret journey and did the same job, but most of them died. For fifteen years he did this.

Once, when all his young trees burned to the ground because of a careless sheepherder, Paul broke down and cried. Then he got up and kept planting. Freezing winds and terrible heat, landslides and floods and fires destroyed (毁坏) his work time and time again. However, he kept planting.

Very slowly, amazing things began to take place. Now the place is fourteen thousand acres of trees, grass and bushes. Many kinds of wildlife live here. Paul received many environmental awards. His hair turned white, but he managed to keep that impossible vow he made to himself as a child.

Just keep working, no matter who criticizes you, no matter how long it takes, no matter how many times you fall.

11\. What did Paul Jackson vow when he was a boy?

A. To work at the copper smelter. B. To make the wasteland green again.

C. To win an environmental award. D. To study the wildlife in the forest.

12\. Which can best explain the underlined phrase "sneaked out" in Paragraph 3?

A. Ran outside excitedly and rapidly. B. Invited others to go out together.

C. Walked out quickly and noisily. D. Left secretly to avoid being noticed.

13\. How did Paul react (反应) when his young trees burned to the ground?

A. He gave up planting from then on. B. He built a wall to protect them.

C. He cried but continued planting. D. He decided to plant different kinds of trees.

14\. What was the result of Paul's long-term efforts?

A. The wildlife all disappeared from the area.

B. Paul became famous and moved to a big city.

C. The area was turned into 14,000 acres of green land.

D. All the trees he planted were destroyed by earthquakes.

【答案】11. B 12. D 13. C 14. C

【解析】

【导语】本文主要介绍保罗幼年目睹家乡因铜冶炼厂污染沦为荒地，立誓要让土地重披绿装。他坚持十五年，荒原终成一万四千英亩的树林、草地和灌木丛，孕育丰富野生动植物群落。他以白发换青葱，践行童稚誓言，诠释了"永不言弃"的环保精神。

【11题详解】

细节理解题。根据"A beautiful forest nearby was made into a wasteland. He vowed (发誓) that someday he would make the land green again."可知，附近的一片美丽森林被变成了荒地。他发誓说，总有一天他会让这片土地重新变得绿意盎然。故选B。

【12题详解】

词句猜测题。根据"Every week, he made his secret journey and did the same job"可知，每周，他都会进行这样的秘密行动，所以sneaked out应该是"偷偷溜走"的意思，故选D。

【13题详解】

细节理解题。根据"Paul broke down and cried. Then he got up and kept planting."可知，保罗情绪崩溃，哭了起来。随后他站起身来，继续播种。故选C。

【14题详解】

细节理解题。根据"Now the place is fourteen thousand acres of trees, grass and bushes."可知，如今这里已变成了一万四千英亩的树林、草地和灌木丛。故选C。

Weiqi, commonly known as Go in English, is a board game that originated in ancient China. The game is considered one of the Four Arts that Chinese literators (文人) were required to master. Besides Weiqi, they had to learn Chinese calligraphy (shu), painting (hua) and guqin playing (qin).

Weiqi has a history of over 4,000 years, even older than Chinese chess. According to some historical records, the game, known as Yi in its early years, is said to have been invented by Yao (尧). Seeing that his son had a bad temper (脾气), Yao was rather worried. So he decided to find something that could help educate his son, and a simple board game came to him.

The rules of Weiqi are simple: using black and white stones (棋子), two players take turns placing their stones on empty cross points of the board. The goal is to surround (包围) a larger total area on the board while preventing one's own stones from being taken by the opponent (对手). Stones do not move and are only taken off the board if they are completely surrounded.

The scene of two people playing Weiqi appears in many traditional Chinese paintings. The image of a player holding a stone over the board, looking for a place to put it, was later turned into a popular Chinese idiom (成语), which means "[unsure about making a move]{.underline}". The expression is still widely used today.

With its development, Weiqi grew in popularity. Later, it spread to Japan, South and North Korea and Western countries. Today, it has become an international board game.

18\. What's the main idea of the second paragraph?

A. The origin (起源) of Weiqi. B. The rules of Weiqi.

C. The development of Weiqi. D. The popularity of Weiqi.

19\. What does the underlined expression "unsure about making a move" mean in the fourth paragraph?

A. 观棋不语 B. 举棋不定 C. 出其不意 D. 棋逢对手

20\. What can we learn from the passage?

A. Weiqi has a history of more than 5,000 years.

B. Weiqi is a simple board game that is enjoyed by the old.

C. Weiqi has become more and more popular around the world.

D. The player who surrounds a smaller total area wins the game.

21\. In which part of a newspaper can you probably read the passage?

A. Science. B. Travel. C. Stories. D. Culture.

【答案】18. A 19. B 20. C 21. D

Nowadays, some companies around the world are now offering humanoid (human-like) robots. They are being designed (设计) to look as human as possible. These products of technology are at the center of a debate (辩论): Should they be made to look like humans or just like what they are machines?

Robots are playing an increasingly bigger role in our lives. In some countries, robots have been entertaining kids and helping the elderly. Some experts say robots will be more effective at such jobs if they look like humans. Research has shown that people feel closer to human-like robots. Also, human-like robots suit environments that are designed for humans. After all, the world is full of stairs (楼梯), hallways, shelves at shoulder height and sightlines at eye level.

But other experts say robots don't need to look like humans. Humanoid robots also have disadvantages. If robots look like us, we may expect them to act like us. However, they may make us disappointed because they can't always do that yet. For example, they can't laugh at the right moments during a conversation. Many people also find human-like robots scary.

I think the human body is not the best design for many of the jobs we want robots to do. Just think of small![](media/精品解析：2025年山东省泰安市中考英语真题 （解析版）_dot_processed_media/image11.wmf){width="5.555555555555555e-2in" height="9.722222222222222e-2in"} flat robot vacuums (真空吸尘器). They can go under a sofa to pick up the dust balls. Can human-like robots also do this? Even if robots can be made into humanlike ones, why do we limit (限定) them to two legs and two arms? Why not four and six so they can pick up the elderly or sick people comfortably? And that super intelligent AI almost certainly wouldn't pick one body design to carry its mind around in. Why limit computational capacity (算力) to what fits inside a single head?

What's your opinion about robots' shapes?

22\. According to the second paragraph, the reasons why robots should be designed to look like humans include \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

①People feel closer to humanoid robots.

②Robots are widely used in the industrial field.

③Humanoid robots can serve the people effectively.

④Humanoid robots can suit human environments.

A. ①②④ B. ①③④ C. ②③④ D. ①②③

23\. Other experts don't agree that robots are designed to look like humans because humanoid robots \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

A. cost a lot B. can't cry or laugh

C. can't have conversations with humans D. can't always behave like us as we expect

24\. What's the writer's opinion according to the fourth paragraph?

A. Robots can't be made to look like humans.

B. Humanoid design is still the best choice for robots.

C. A robot should be designed with more arms, legs and heads.

D. The design of a robot's shape should depend on its use.

25\. What's the best title of this passage?

A. The Development of Humanoid Robots

B. A Debate about Improving the Services of Robots

C. Should Robots Look like Humans?

D. Different Robots, Different Services

Have you ever been in trouble and wanted to get away? The white-tailed deer can swim, run, hide and fight to stay out of trouble.

In early April, fawns (baby deer) are born. After a few weeks, the doe (the mother deer) leaves her fawns to find food. [\_\_\_\_26\_\_\_\_]{.underline} The trees and grass can help keep the fawns from being seen by hungry predators (掠食者).

The fawns' camouflage (伪装；保护色) hides them in April's trees and golden grasses. [\_\_\_\_27\_\_\_\_]{.underline} In summer, the fawns' white spots disappear and never come back. In winter, their fur is gray, which helps them hide in the snow.

When the deer see, smell or hear something suspicious (可疑的), they stick their white tails up to signal that danger is near. [\_\_\_\_28\_\_\_\_]{.underline}

When a deer is chased into water, it knows what to do. It runs into the water and swims to the deepest part. [\_\_\_\_29\_\_\_\_]{.underline} The deer will kick and thrash until the predator dies or walks off wounded.

[\_\_\_\_30\_\_\_\_]{.underline} If a deer is in a wide-open field and notices a predator, it will run in a zigzag (之字形) to get away. It runs in this way to confuse (混淆) the predator. If the deer ran straight, it would likely become a big meal.

Many people believe that exercising on an empty stomach burns more calories (卡路里). But research shows that it doesn't actually make much of a difference. Does that mean you should eat a lot of protein and carbs (蛋白质和碳水化合物) right before exercising? No, that's not true, [\_\_\_\_36\_\_\_\_]{.underline}.Take a look at when and how you should eat, before, after, or even during exercise.

The calories in food provide the [\_\_\_\_37\_\_\_\_]{.underline} you need for exercising. But eating too much right before exercise can cause problems. Exercising [\_\_\_\_38\_\_\_\_]{.underline} blood from organs (器官), including the stomach, to the muscles (肌肉). So exercising on a full stomach influences digestion (消化), which could make you feel [\_\_\_\_39\_\_\_\_]{.underline} or sick. That's particularly true of meals high in fat, protein or fiber, which take longer to digest than carbs. Experts suggest eating more carbs than protein before exercising and [\_\_\_\_40\_\_\_\_]{.underline} two to three hours before starting exercise.

Protein is easier to digest [\_\_\_\_41\_\_\_\_]{.underline} exercise. If you have to wait an hour or more for a full meal, it's better to have a high-protein snack to help control your appetite (食欲). People who are too hungry are more likely to eat too much of the [\_\_\_\_42\_\_\_\_]{.underline} food!

Most people who are eating enough throughout the day don't need [\_\_\_\_43\_\_\_\_]{.underline} during exercise. But if you are training for more than an hour, you might benefit (受益) from a carb-rich snack in the [\_\_\_\_44\_\_\_\_]{.underline}.

However, experts agree that the most important part is a balanced diet. What you eat matters more than [\_\_\_\_45\_\_\_\_]{.underline} you eat.

【答案】36. either

39\. uncomfortable
